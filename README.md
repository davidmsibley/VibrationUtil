# VibrationUtil

Variable duration Android Vibration.  Used by calling as a Unity Engine Plugin.

Nobody should pay money for this dead simple functionality, and nobody should
spend as much time as I did banging my stupid head on this.

Use [this example](/app/src/test/examples/PluginBridge.cs), put the jar and the
[example AndroidManifest.xml](/app/src/test/examples/AndroidManifest.xml) in
the Assets/Plugins/Android folder and be done with it.
